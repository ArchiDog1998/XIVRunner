This is a repo in Dalamud for auto-moving the character.

This is by changing the camera direction and turning on the `automove` to make this idea come true.

[RebornBuddy](https://www.rebornbuddy.com/) can make the character move directly, But I don't know how to do it in Dalamud. If you have any ideas, you can PR to this repo.
